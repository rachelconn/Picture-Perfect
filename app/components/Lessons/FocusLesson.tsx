        Having proper focus is one of the most important aspects of photography:
        even to the untrained eye, an out-of-focus image is easy to recognize
        and can draw attention from anything else in a photo.

        It's important to have a good understanding of how to control focus,
        as the way an image is focused has a huge effect on how people look at it.
        For now, you'll be experimenting with how to get a photograph in focus.
        In a later lesson, you'll be manipulating focus to emphasize your subject
        by having it in-focus and the background out-of-focus.

      <Article.SectionHeader>How Focus Works</Article.SectionHeader>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        When taking a photograph, the focus is adjusted by changing the distance between the camera's image plane and lens.
        Depending on this distance, a different area (known as the "plane of focus") will be in perfect focus,
        and anything outside of the plane of focus will be blurred:
        objects close to it will only be slightly blurred, while objects far outside of it can become very blurry.

        Adjusting focus is fairly straightforward, as on a smartphone there are only two factors you can control:
        the camera's focus distance, which determines how far the plane of focus is from the camera,
        and your distance from objects in the image.
        Generally, it's a good idea to first get into position for the shot composition that you want,
        then adjust the focus distance until your subject is in focus.

      <Article.Paragraph>
        Use what you learned to take a picture that's entirely in focusâ€”
        don't worry too much about controlling anything else about the photo.
        We recommend you take a picture of something that's relatively flat that
        has enough detail to tell whether the image is in focus
        (such as text or an interesting pattern), but feel free to take a picture
        of anything you want!
