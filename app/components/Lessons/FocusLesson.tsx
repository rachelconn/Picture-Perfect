      <Article.Paragraph>
        Having proper focus is one of the most important aspects of photography:
        even to the untrained eye, an out-of-focus image is easy to recognize
        and can draw attention from anything else in a photo.

      <Article.Paragraph>
        It's important to have a good understanding of how to control focus,
        as the way an image is focused has a huge effect on how people look at it.
        For now, you'll be experimenting with how to get a photograph in focus.
        In a later lesson, you'll be manipulating focus to emphasize your subject
        by having it in-focus and the background out-of-focus.

      <Article.SectionHeader>How Focus Works</Article.SectionHeader>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        When taking a photograph, the focus is adjusted by changing the distance between the camera's image plane and lens.
        Depending on this distance, a different area (known as the "plane of focus") will be in perfect focus,
        and anything outside of the plane of focus will be blurred depending on how far it is from the plane.
        To make sure an image is in focus, you will need to either adjust the camera's focus distance,
        or move such that the plane of focus overlaps with your subject.

      <Article.Paragraph>
        Use what you learned to take a picture that's entirely in focusâ€”
        don't worry too much about controlling anything else about the photo.
        We recommend you take a picture of something that's relatively flat that
        has enough detail to tell whether the image is in focus
        (such as text or an interesting pattern), but feel free to take a picture
        of anything you want!
