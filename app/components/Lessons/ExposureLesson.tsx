        <Article.Paragraph>
          The exposure of a photograph is defined as the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor.
          It may be easier to think of exposure simply as how bright a photograph isâ€” a properly exposed photo tends to have colors close to real life,
          while photo that looks bright and washed out can be called "overexposed"
          and a photo where the subject is hardly visible is called "underexposed".
          Here are some example photographs: think about whether you would consider each one underexposed, overexposed, or properly exposed before reading the caption for an explanation.

        <Article.Paragraph>
          Now that you have an idea of what exposure is and how to evaluate it, the next step is to think about how to get the proper exposure in images you take.
          While most cameras automatically adjust exposure by default, manually setting your exposure often produces better results.
          There are two settings that determine the exposure of a photograph: the ISO and exposure time.
          Understanding exposure time is fairly straightforward: it is simply the amount of time the camera's light sensors are exposed to light.
          Therefore, increasing the exposure time will let them absorb more light, and increase the exposure of an image accordingly.
          The darker your environment, the more you will have to increase exposure time to absorb the little light that is available.

        <Article.Paragraph>
          On the other hand, ISO is a little more complicated to understand.
          Essentially, ISO determines how sensitive the camera's sensors are to light,
          meaning that with the same exposure time, a photo with a higher ISO value will take in more light and have higher exposure.
          While this means that adjusting the ISO value and exposure time can be used to change the exposure overall,
          it's important to consider ISO's effect on noise.
