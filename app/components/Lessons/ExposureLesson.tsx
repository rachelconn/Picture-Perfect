      <Article.SectionHeader>What Is Exposure?</Article.SectionHeader>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        The exposure of a photograph is defined as the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor.
        It may be easier to think of exposure simply as how bright a photograph isâ€” a properly exposed photo tends to have colors close to real life,
        while photo that looks bright and washed out can be called "overexposed"
        and a photo where the subject is hardly visible is called "underexposed".
        Here are some example photographs: think about whether you would consider each one underexposed, overexposed, or properly exposed before reading the caption for an explanation.

      <Article.SectionHeader>Adjusting Exposure</Article.SectionHeader>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        Now that you have an idea of what exposure is and how to evaluate it, the next step is to think about how to get the proper exposure in images you take.
        While most cameras automatically adjust exposure by default, manually setting your exposure often produces better results.
        There are two settings that determine the exposure of a photograph: the ISO and exposure time.
        Understanding exposure time is fairly straightforward: it is simply the amount of time the camera's light sensors are exposed to light.
        Therefore, increasing the exposure time will let them absorb more light, and increase the exposure of an image accordingly.
        The darker your environment, the more you will have to increase exposure time to absorb the little light that is available.
      </Article.Paragraph>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        On the other hand, ISO is a little more complicated to understand.
        Essentially, ISO determines how sensitive the camera's sensors are to light,
        meaning that with the same exposure time, a photo with a higher ISO value will take in more light and have higher exposure.
        While this means that adjusting the ISO value and exposure time can be used to change the exposure overall,
        it's important to consider ISO's effect on noise.
      </Article.Paragraph>
      <Article.SectionHeader>Dealing With Noise</Article.SectionHeader>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        While increasing the ISO of a photo will let you get the same level of exposure with a shorter shutter speed,
        it also has a tendency to produce digital noise.
        Since the camera's sensors are more sensitive, they can pick up erroneous information that leads to photos that look fuzzy or grainy.
        This grain is known as noise, and knowing how to control the amount of noise in an image is key to taking great photographs.
      </Article.Paragraph>
      <Article.CaptionedImage source={noisyImage} caption={noisyImageCaption} />
      <Article.Paragraph>
        To minimize noise, you should adjust exposure primarily by changing the shutter speed,
        using the lowest ISO value that allows you to keep the photo properly exposed.
        For photos in still settings, you might be able to get away with using an exposure time of half a second or more if necessary,
        but some situations (for example, trying to take a photo of a car or moving animal) could cause motion blur even with an exposure time of 1/100 of a second.
        With longer exposure times, be sure to keep your camera still to avoid motion blur caused by the shakiness of your hands!
        Using a tripod can help with this immensely.

        Overall, the process of creating a properly exposed photo will look something like this:

        <Article.ListItem>Determine an initial exposure time based on the movement of your subject and background</Article.ListItem>
        <Article.ListItem>Adjust ISO to a value that leads to proper exposure with your chosen exposure time</Article.ListItem>
        <Article.ListItem>Take a photo, adjusting the appropriate setting if there's digital noise or smearing</Article.ListItem>
      </Article.NumberedList>
      <Article.Paragraph>
        Now that you know what settings are responsible for adjusting exposure and what proper exposure look like, it's time to practice taking well-exposed photos!
        Go into a well-lit room and find any subject you're interested in photographing, then try to take a well-exposed picture.
        Once you take the photo, we'll rate your photo and let you know how you did.
