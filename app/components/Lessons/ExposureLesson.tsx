          The exposure of a photograph is defined as the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor.
          It may be easier to think of exposure simply as how bright a photograph isâ€” a properly exposed photo tends to have colors close to real life,
          while photo that looks bright and washed out can be called "overexposed"
          and a photo where the subject is hardly visible is called "underexposed".
          Here are some example photographs: think about whether you would consider each one underexposed, overexposed, or properly exposed before reading the caption for an explanation.
